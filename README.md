# 🛡️ SENTINEL — AI-Powered Secure Identity, Evidence & Criminal Network Intelligence Platform

> **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) Prototype**  
> **Primary Problem Statement:** PS189 — AI-Powered Criminal Network Analysis System  
> **Supporting Capability:** AI-Based Identity & Document Intelligence  
> **Core Tagline:** *Identity → Evidence → Connections → Intelligence*

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer & Ethical Notice
This platform is a **prototype designed exclusively for demonstration during the Smart India Hackathon**. It uses **100% fictional, synthetic, and deterministic demo data**. It does not connect to real government databases, telecom backbones, actual CCTV networks, or live facial recognition surveillance infrastructure. All analytical outputs represent **investigative leads requiring human verification and do not constitute legal conclusions or proof of guilt**.

---

## 🎯 Executive Overview
Modern criminal investigations are hindered by fragmented, silod evidentiary data—ranging from forged identification documents and sporadic ANPR vehicle captures to cross-jurisdictional case files.

**SENTINEL** resolves this challenge by turning fragmented investigation data into explainable, cryptographic connections:
1. **Document Intelligence**: Deep forensic scrutiny, OCR extraction, and MRZ validation of submitted identity assets.
2. **Deterministic Entity Resolution**: Correlating ambiguous aliases, physical records, and document numbers into unified identity clusters.
3. **Interactive Knowledge Graph**: Visualizing multi-dimensional relationships across Persons, Vehicles, Identifiers, Locations, and Cases.
4. **Cross-Case Intelligence**: Highlighting overlapping nodes across seemingly disconnected ongoing investigations.
5. **Geospatial & Timeline Reconstruction**: Synchronized chronological playback of events and vector map visualization.
6. **Explainable AI Investigation Engine**: Rule-based detection of network hubs, co-occurrences, and suspicious patterns with explicit supporting indicators.
7. **Zero-Trust Security & Evidence Chain of Custody**: Strict RBAC, session management, tamper-evident SHA-256 evidence hashing, and immutable audit trails.

7. **Cross-Case Intelligence (`/cross-case`)**:
   - Highlight the cross-case correlation between **Case #2026-041**, **Case #2026-017**, and **Case #2025-089**.
   - View the entity overlap matrix confirming shared vehicle and location footprints.
8. **Timeline Reconstruction (`/timeline`)**:
   - Filter chronological events: 09:40 (Bhopal Central) → 10:15 (Transit Checkpoint Alpha) → 11:05 (Industrial Sector 7) → 12:10 (Lake Road Camera).
9. **Geospatial Intelligence (`/map`)**:
   - View the vector intelligence map showing camera clusters and checkpoints connected sequentially.

12. **Tamper-Evident Audit Ledger (`/audit`)**:
    - Confirm the full action log recording Officer O-102's access history, and demonstrate access denial when attempting to access unauthorized files.

---

## 🔒 Security Architecture
- **Zero Trust Principles**: Principle of least privilege enforced across all 5 user tiers.
- **Server-Side Authorization**: API routes and views validate role permissions server-side.
- **Tamper-Evident Evidence**: Every evidentiary object possesses a deterministic 256-bit SHA digest computed from file bytes.
- **Session Protection**: Strict HttpOnly cookies without insecure `localStorage` tokens.
- **Audit Completeness**: All access attempts (allowed and denied) generate structured runtime audit events.
